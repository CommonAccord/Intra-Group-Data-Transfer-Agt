Note=This step shows Acme, which is a member of the community agreement, extending the agreement into its own Affiliates.  The Affiliates sign this Agreement with Acme Inc. as Lead Party.  The Miscellaneous section "Entire Agreement" clause references the community agreement as the "parent" of the current one.  This could also be chained if, for instance, Acme had a group of companies in one country or a group of contracting parties that it wished to include, while maintaining a hierarchy of legal relationships and customizations.
